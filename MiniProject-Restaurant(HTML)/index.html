          <p>
            By looking at pictures of different breakfast ideas, you're sure to
            come across a bunch of new ideas that you have never before
            considered. Hopefully, a few of those will sound appealing and you
            have been inspired to try something new for breakfast.

            It can also be a fun way to surprise others. You might choose to
            share a random sentence on social media just to see what type of
            reaction it garners from others. It's an unexpected move that might
            create more conversation than a typical post or tweet.

          <p>
            For those who write, this tool can be an excellent device to aid in
            the creative writing process. By using the tool to create 5 random
            words, a writer could then attempt to use all of them in a single
            paragraph. Longer random word lists could be incorporated into a
            short story.
