                2018 was a year of changes and evolution for our organization. Therefore, the first weeks of this year were the right occasion to look into the future and determine our focus areas for 2019. The diversity of our region invites us to prepare to implement the Annual Plan of the Internet Society, while we lay the foundations to participate in the debates that will take place in the years to come.
                I have no doubt that, together with our vibrant community of chapters and members, we will make significant progress in favor of an open, globally-connected, secure, and trustworthy Internet for everyone.
